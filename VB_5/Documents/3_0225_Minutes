Discussed flow of work. Settled to start with CI/CD, then working on Mockito, then implementing core features. For the core features, login, signup and registration will not be counted. 

Team members are also urged to divide tasks more equally amongst each member for better grade distribution.

Git issues should be used often as that is how the TA can check in on our respective progress. 

For backend:
Backend should use Mockito, a testing feature. It is meant for layer by layer testing. 

For frontend:
Should use Mockito as well.
